# V2G-G2V
# Power Converter Topologies for Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V) Technologies

The objective of this project is to design and implement power converter topologies for bi-direction power flow in V2G (Vehicle to Grid) and G2V (Grid to Vehicle) technologies. It will support both the grid (in place) and traction (vehicle) with added auxiliary loads, Also by controlling bidirectional charging and discharging services of battery efficiently, it can further make it more suitable for renewable energy integration. A better solution where the battery system can be used to support the services, wherein the battery is still part of the source.

This project provides a detailed technical assessment, with various power electronics topologies, modeling and control strategies designed in terms of harmonics and dynamic response.
